This system uses smarts (machine learning) to guess flight prices. It learns from past flight info, like the place you're going, the airline, and when you fly. With this knowledge, it can predict prices for upcoming flights. This helps you find cheaper flights and save money on your travels! The system can learn even more by adding more information in the future.


What type of machine learning algorithms are commonly used for predicting flight prices? 

Smart Guessers: This is a common approach, and algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors fall into this category. They work by finding past flights that are similar to your desired flight (same route, time of year, etc.) and use the prices of those past flights to predict the price of your new flight.
Question Master: This could involve algorithms like Decision Trees. These algorithms ask a series of questions about your desired flight (departure date, airline, etc.) and based on your answers, they narrow down the possibilities and predict a price range.

What is the future scope of this project?

Machine Learning algorithms are applied on the dataset to predict the dynamic fare of flights and hotel price. This gives the predicted values of flight fare to get a flight ticket at minimum cost and minimum hotel cost. Data is collected from the websites which sell the flight tickets so only limited information can be accessed.


It's important to note that these are predictions, not guarantees. Flight prices can still change, but this system gives you a helpful starting point for finding the best deals.
